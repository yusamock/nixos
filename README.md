## usage
since all of this files are reproduciable, you dont need to symlink (i just recommend to have flakes and home-manager pre-enabled, since i tried to test it and broke my install, lmafo)


## apps !
* <code>home-manager</code> configs on modules
* <code>nvim</code> cool ide !
* <code>starship</code> cool shell prompt
* <code>librewolf</code> open source and private browser (with firefox-colors everblush)
* <code>waybar & hyprland</code> bloated ahh (but beauty af) wayland wm & also bloated (but can be awesome and multi-functional) bar



## credits !
thx alot for [juweeism](https://github.com/juweeism/home.nix) for the config format !
